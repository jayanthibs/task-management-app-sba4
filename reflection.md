Challenges faced during the project.

The main challenges were saving and updating tasks correctly using localStorage, comparing dates to identify overdue tasks, and updating the task list dynamically when filtering or changing task status.

How you approached solving those challenges.

I solved these challenges by carefully updating the localStorage whenever a task changed, using JavaScript Date objects to check deadlines, and writing functions to render the task list so that it always showed the correct tasks and statuses.

What you would improve if given more time.

If I had more time, I would have improved the user interface to make it more visually appealing, added a select dropdown for filter category, and used a select dropdown for overdue status as well.
